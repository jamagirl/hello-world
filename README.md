Hello Sugar Labs,

I'm Georgie, part-time high school student and part-time anxious mess!
During my spare time, I write in my bullet journal and binge watch Netflix shows (I'm currently watching She's Gotta Have It)
One day I dream of becoming a front-end developer and maybe become a creative technology director at a "certain" Fortune 500 company... *cough* *cough* Google *cough* but I'll take whatever company...
